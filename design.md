1. Outdoor lights:
Depending on how close the user is the light will change. If the potentiometer reads the user above 510 the outdoor light will turn on. However if theyre under 510 the light will turn red and be dimmed.

2. Humidity/moisture sensor
If the humidity is below 50 the fan will be turned on on low, otherwise the fan will be high speed

3. Panic Button:
if the button is pressed the motor module will close the blinds and call the police, if the button is pressed again soon after it will reopen the blinds (resetting the button)
